Backend Web API Project for managing Books (borrow, return), authors (get statistics), borrowers (Get Current
and overdue loans), and Users (Login, Register,ForgetPassword,ChangePassword, and manage using ASP.NET Core Identity). applying
authentication and authorization using JWT, Entity framework Core, Logging, Caching API Responses , Searching
And Sorting Responses , DTO, Documentation. also Using AI to optimize my solutions after apply first to get
more knowledge while making projects.

- DTOs - Shapping the response that returned from the DataAccess.
- Options Design Pattern - To map settings at appsettings Json.
- Repository Design Pattern - For handling Database access.
- Unit Of Work Design Pattern - To Unifiy Repositories that access database under on class, and saving to database at one transaction.
